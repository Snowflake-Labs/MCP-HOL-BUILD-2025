# BUILD Agent Powered Workflows Using Snowflake Cortex AI and Managed MCP Servers

## Overview

We'll build a health research agent that uses MCP tools to query:
- PubMed for medical literature
- Clinical trials databases for trial information

We'll also show a powerful evaluation flow using AI Observability that you can use to improve your MCP tool descriptions.

Get started by opening the [notebook](./build-and-evaluate-langgraph-agents-with-mcp-tools.ipynb) and following the instructions there.
